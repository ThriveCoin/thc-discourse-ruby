##
# A note on determining whether an upload should be marked as secure:
#
# Some of these flags checked (e.g. all of the for_X flags and the opts[:type])
# are only set when _initially uploading_ via UploadCreator and are not present
# when an upload already exists, these will only be checked when the @creating
# option is present.
#
# If the upload already exists the best way to figure out whether it should be
# secure alongside the site settings is the access_control_post_id, because the
# original post the upload is linked to has far more bearing on its security context
# post-upload. If the access_control_post_id does not exist then we just rely
# on the current secure? status, otherwise there would be a lot of additional
# complex queries and joins to perform. Over time more of these specific
# queries will be implemented.
#
# NOTE: When updating this to add more cases where uploads will be marked
# secure, consider uploads:secure_upload_analyse_and_update as well, which
# does not use this class directly but uses an SQL version of its rules for
# efficient updating of many uploads in bulk.
